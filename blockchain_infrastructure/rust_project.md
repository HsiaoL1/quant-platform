Building the Blockchain Infrastructure in Rust as outlined in project.md
  is an ambitious and highly technical task that goes far beyond simply interacting
  with an existing chain. You are essentially building your own custom blockchain
  tailored for DeFi. This is where Rust and the Substrate framework shine.

  Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to implementing this module. This plan
  assumes you are building a sovereign chain that will eventually host the Solidity
  smart contracts (via an EVM compatibility layer) and/or have its logic natively
  built.

  Core Technology Stack

   * Blockchain Framework: Substrate - The de facto standard for building custom,
     high-performance blockchains in Rust. It's modular, forkless-upgradable, and the
     foundation of Polkadot and Kusama.
   * Smart Contract Environment: `pallet-contracts` for Wasm-based contracts and
     `pallet-evm` (Frontier) for full Ethereum/EVM compatibility. This is how you
     will run the Solidity contracts from your smart_contracts directory on your
     custom chain.
   * IDE: VS Code with the rust-analyzer extension is highly recommended.

  Phase 1: Building the Custom Blockchain Node (The Foundation)

  The first goal is to get a basic, runnable blockchain node up and running. This
  will be the server application that nodes in your network will run.

  Step 1.1: Environment Setup
   1. Install Rust: Follow the official instructions at rustup.rs
      (https://rustup.rs/).
   2. Install Substrate Prerequisites: Substrate has a number of dependencies. Run the
      following command to prepare your environment:
   1     curl https://get.substrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
      This script will install the necessary toolchains and packages.

  Step 1.2: Scaffold Your Node
   1. Use the Node Template: Substrate provides a template for a bare-bones
      blockchain. This is your starting point.

   1     git clone
     https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template
   2     cd substrate-node-template
   2. Compile and Run: Compile the node for the first time. This will take a while.

   1     cargo build --release
   2     ./target/release/node-template --dev
      You now have a local, single-node blockchain running! You can interact with
  it using the Polkadot-JS Apps UI
  (https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer).

  Step 1.3: Add Smart Contract Functionality (EVM Compatibility)
  Your goal is to run the Solidity contracts. To do this, you need to make your
  Substrate chain EVM-compatible by adding the Frontier pallets.

   1. Add Dependencies: Open the runtime/Cargo.toml file and add the necessary
      Frontier and EVM pallets.

   1     # In [dependencies]
   2     pallet-evm = { version = "...", default-features = false, features =
     ["forbid-evm-reentrancy"] }
   3     pallet-ethereum = { version = "...", default-features = false }
   4     # ... and other required Frontier pallets
   2. Configure the Runtime: In runtime/src/lib.rs, you will need to:
       * Implement the configuration traits for pallet_evm and pallet_ethereum. This
         involves defining things like the ChainId, how to map account types, and how
         to handle gas fees.
       * Add the pallets to the construct_runtime! macro. This macro is the heart of
         your chain's logic, defining which modules (pallets) are included in the
         runtime.
   3. Recompile: Run cargo build --release again. Once complete, your node can now
      deploy and execute Solidity smart contracts. You can use standard Ethereum tools
      like Remix or Hardhat (by pointing them to your node's RPC endpoint) to deploy
      the contracts from smart_contracts/src.

  Phase 2: Implementing the High-Performance Transaction Processor

  This isn't a separate component but rather an optimization and enhancement of your
  Substrate node.

  Step 2.1: Benchmark Your Pallets
  Substrate uses a weight system (similar to gas in Ethereum) to measure
  computation. To ensure performance and prevent network spam, you must benchmark
  your runtime's functions.

   1. Run Benchmarks: For each pallet in your runtime (including the ones you just
      added), you'll run a benchmarking command:
   1     ./target/release/node-template benchmark pallet --pallet pallet_evm
     --extrinsic '*' --steps 50 --repeat 20 --output
     runtime/src/weights/pallet_evm.rs
   2. Integrate Weights: Include the generated weight files in your runtime to provide
      accurate transaction costs.

  Step 2.2: Utilize Off-Chain Workers (OCWs)
  For tasks that are too computationally expensive or require access to external
  data (like calling a web API for a price feed), use OCWs. They run in a separate,
  non-deterministic environment within the node.

   1. Design an OCW: For example, you could create an OCW within a custom pallet that
      fetches price data from multiple exchanges, aggregates it, and submits a signed
      transaction with the median price back to the chain. This is a robust way to
      build a custom oracle.
   2. Implement the OCW: In a custom pallet, you'll add a #[pallet::hooks] section and
      implement the offchain_worker function. Inside this function, you can use Rust
      libraries like reqwest to make HTTP calls.

  Phase 3: Building MEV Protection

  This is a highly advanced topic. Here are concrete strategies you can implement
  at the node level.

  Step 3.1: Create a Private Transaction Pool
  The simplest form of MEV protection is to prevent front-running by not
  broadcasting transactions to the public mempool.

   1. Custom RPC Endpoint: Create a new RPC endpoint in your node. This endpoint will
      take a transaction and send it directly to the block authoring logic, bypassing
      the public transaction queue.
   2. Transaction Handling: The block authoring logic needs to be modified to accept
      transactions from this private channel and include them in the block it's
      building.

  Step 3.2: Implement Transaction Ordering Logic
  Instead of purely fee-based ordering, you can enforce a different scheme.

   1. Modify Block Production: In the node's service file (node/src/service.rs), you
      can customize how the block is built.
   2. Implement First-In, First-Out (FIFO): Access the transaction pool and sort the
      transactions by the time they were received, rather than by the fee they offer.
      This neutralizes the most common front-running and sandwich attacks.

  Phase 4: Designing the Cross-Chain Bridge

  This is the most complex component. The most pragmatic approach is to start with
  a federated bridge.

  Step 4.1: Create the Bridge Pallet
  This pallet will manage the logic of locking, minting, and burning assets on your
  Substrate chain.

   1. Define Storage:
       * AssetMapping: A map from an external asset's ID (e.g., Ethereum contract
         address) to a local asset ID on your chain.
       * FederationMembers: A list of trusted accounts that can authorize bridge
         operations.
   2. Define Extrinsics (Functions):
       * propose_transfer(from, to, amount, chain_id): Called by a federation member
         to signal an incoming transfer from another chain.
       * vote_on_transfer(...): Called by other members to vote on the proposal.
       * execute_mint(...): When enough votes are gathered, this function is
         automatically called to mint the corresponding wrapped asset on your chain.

  Step 4.2: Build the Off-Chain Relayer Service
  This is a separate Rust application that the federation members will run.

   1. Listen to Source Chain: Use a library like ethers-rs to connect to an Ethereum
      node and listen for Deposit events from a specific contract.
   2. Submit to Substrate Chain: When a Deposit event is confirmed, the relayer will
      automatically call the propose_transfer extrinsic on your Substrate node using a
      Substrate API client library like subxt.
   3. Consensus: The relayers of the federation members will all see the same event
      and submit their own proposals/votes, triggering the minting process on your
      chain.

  By following these phases, you will systematically build a powerful, custom
  blockchain in Rust that fulfills all the requirements of the Blockchain
  Infrastructure section of your project plan. You'd start with a working chain,
  add the ability to run your existing Solidity contracts, and then progressively
  enhance it with native, high-performance DeFi modules.
